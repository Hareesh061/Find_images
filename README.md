**APIs increase business agility. By abstracting away the underlying complexity of a service and presenting it as a product, APIs give organizations secure access to data, services, and operating systems that drive innovation for internal partners and third-party consumers.**

**When built well, APIs enable developers to be more productive by allowing them to reuse an existing API rather than building new code each time.
The language-independent nature of APIs enables rapid development and deployment of small, modular applications. APIs can also leverage a vast range of already-built third-party services and data sources.**

**Another benefit of APIs is related to API monetization. Organizations developing APIs for public consumption can offer a free tier for regular usage, but they can also charge if callers reach certain request counts or want access to premium API features or endpoints.**
